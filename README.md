# Drake Calculator

## Introduction
`Drake Calculator` is a sophisticated application crafted to compute and visualize the results of the famed Drake equation. This equation, proposed by Frank Drake in 1961, estimates the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The calculator not only allows users to input values for various parameters of the equation but also provides an intuitive interface to help understand the significance of each factor.
